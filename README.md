// running procedure

1.Input Phase
- User enters a word, phrase, or number.

2.Processing Phase
- Remove spaces, punctuation, and convert to lowercase (if needed).
- Reverse the string/number.
- Compare original with reversed version.

3.Output Phase
- Display whether the input is a palindrome or not.

// flow of project
1.  Start application.
2. 	Prompt user for input.
3. 	Normalize input (clean formatting).
4. 	Reverse input.
5. 	Compare original vs reversed.
6. 	Display result.
7. 	Optionally allow multiple checks in one session.

// objective

- To create a simple application that determines whether a given input (word, phrase, or number) reads the same forwards and backwards.
- To strengthen understanding of string manipulation, conditional logic, and algorithm design.
- To provide a practical example of how programming concepts can be applied to solve real-world problems in a clear, interactive way.
- To serve as a learning project for beginners, helping them practice coding fundamentals like input handling, loops, functions, and edge case testing.

// Topics to be covered 

- String manipulation (lowercasing, trimming, reversing).
- Loops and conditionals (for comparison logic).
- Functions (modular design for reusability).
- User input/output handling.
- Edge cases (empty strings, numbers, special characters).
- Testing & debugging (validating correctness).

// Usecase

- Educational tool: Helps beginners learn programming concepts.
- Data validation: Can be used in applications where symmetry or consistency checks are needed.
- Fun utility: Quick way to test words or phrases for palindromes.
- Interview prep: Common coding exercise for algorithm practice.
